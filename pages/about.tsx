                    Hi, I'm Thameem, a passionate developer, currently working as a Product Engineer at UST.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I have completed my undergraduate in Electronics and communication engineering from TKM College of
                    Engineering.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I love to work on various modern platforms and learn cutting-edge technologies in software
                    engineering, design & architecture, cyber security, etc.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I enjoy contributing to society. During my graduation, I got selected for the Microsoft student
                    partner program, which helps fellow students to develop their technical and career skills for the
                    future.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I have also volunteered as the webmaster of IEEE, the world's largest professional organisation for
                    engineers and as the chief executive officer of the innovation and entrepreneurship cell (IEDC).
                    <br/><br/>
                    IEDC is working under the guidance of the Kerala Start-Up Mission, which aims to promote the
                    institutional vision of transforming youngsters into technological entrepreneurs and innovative
                    leaders.
